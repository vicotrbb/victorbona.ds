I was hired for Majoris to perform two main tasks. Improve their OCR performance and help at back-end software development. To improve the OCR quality I have developed a service that performs image quality augmentation through techniques that would help the OCR parsing(contrast increase, noise removal, greyscaling, resizing, object selection, etc...). After the service started, the OCR had a significant performance increase and parsing errors have dropped, reducing the necessity of human review.

After the OCR task, I have helped the back-end development team, working with node.js(AdonisJs framework) and mongoDB.
