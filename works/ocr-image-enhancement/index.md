I was hired for Majoris to perform two main tasks during the period I have worked for them, improve their OCR performance and improve software development speed. So, to improve the OCR quality I have developed a service that performs image quality augmentation through techniques that would help the OCR parsing. 

After the service started to perform the job, they had a significant performance increase and OCR parsing errors have dropped.
