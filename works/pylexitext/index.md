During one of my personal projects development, I realized that I have accumulated enough knowledge, technology, know-how, code's that I could create my personal contribution to the open source community, creating a tool that encapsulates several techniques and technologies for text features comprehension and analysis. This tool borns as Pylexitext a python library that implements methods to work with text, like: reading difficulty(Implemeting some equations like SMOG, Gunning fog index, Flesch reading ease, Fleschâ€“Kincaid grade level and others), auto features extraction, features graphing, text classification using NLP and ML and others things.

The project repository can be found: https://github.com/vicotrbb/Pylexitext.

Feel free to contribute!
